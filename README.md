# Final Year Computer Science Student majoring in Data Science at UQ

### Education
Bachelor of Computer Science - Data Science | The University of Queensland July 2022 - June 2025

### Work Experience
**AI & Data Consulting Vacationer @ EY (_Nov 2024 - Dec 2024_)**
- Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline model utilising Microsoft Azure Services.
- Pipeline was able to ingest documents into Azure Blob Storage, then Azure Document Intelligence was used to extract contents from the complex layouts in the documents held in Azure Blob Storage container. Langchain was used to chunk the contents and keep reference to the metadata such as Document name and page number where this chunk content came from. Azure AI search was used to store the chunks and conduct similatiry search. The similarity search was a hybrid between vector search and semantic search which allows for vector similarity and the model being able to understand the semantic meaning of the user's query. 
- Based on the user's query, the most relevant chunks were sent to OpenAI LLM to be able to use the relevant chunks and the prompt we provide to generate a coherent natural response. 
- Presented our POC solution to a wide range of audience members which included technical and non-technical people.

  
**Customer Service Specialist @ ProbeCX (_Aug 2022 - Present_)**
- Delivering exceptional customer service to customers of the Australian Tax Office using effective communication over the phone.
- Consistently analyzing and evaluating Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to improve performance.
- Proficiently utilizing a range of systems to assist clients in fulfilling their requests.


### Project Experience
WinDash - Innovative Household Energy Monitoring
- Worked in a team of 6, where I was mainly involved in the machine learning and data analysis tasks.
- Used LSTM ML model to be able to predict the user's daily or weekly energy usage. This was then converted to estimate the user's energy bill.
-  MERN stack used for the mobile application where React Native and Node.JS used for front-end and MongoDB for the backend for the application.

Forecasting bicycle usage on Bicentennial Bikeway in Milton
- Creating predictions of future bicycle usage using Pandas, NumPy libraries.
- Decomposing the training data using STR decomposition processes and fitting the data to an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model.
- Evaluating the model and adjusting parameters to enhance the model.
- Testing the model by evaluating test data against real time data.

NFL Fantasy Helper - Cloud Computing Project
- Utilised Apache Spark framework and Hadoop Distributed File System on a virtual machine on GCP to perform analysis of NFL dataset.
- Created 4 queries using SparkSQL with visualisations to assist NFL fantasy players with data driven insights.
